Submitting Jobs
---------------

Submitting a job to the Newton Sub-cluster is accomplished in a similar manner to the TORQUE jobs 
on euler. The easiest method is to add the directive ``#PBS -q @newton`` to your submission script. At this point, your job can be executed using ``qsub [script]`` from Euler or Newton.
